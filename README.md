Interface Software Development Kit
============
Providing an easy, modular way to develop using an combination of input devices

# Description

The Interface Software Development Kit is a collection of files developed in Java that enables interfacing with and use of external input devices, such as the Microsoft Kinect, for use in developing visualizations. These visualizations can be developed in multiple formats such as [Processing][1] or [AWT][2], and are designed to behave consistently between different formats. 

# Getting Started

New users should consult our [guide][3] to get started with using the SDK. This guide will walk through initial platform setup and how to run modules using the SDK. If you would like to jump into developing your own modules, see [Extending Modules][4] for more information about specific formats or our [tutorial series][14] for help with specific functionalities.

# Samples

See our [Examples][5] page for links to launchers, visualizations, and documented code. 

# API-Specific Documents

[Here][9] is a brief introduction to the Interface API. Or, if you'd like to jump straight in, here are introductions to the main components:

- [Module Management API][10]
- [Hardware Management API][11]
- [Event Management API][12]
- [Introduction to Receivers][13]

# Contacts/Maintainers
Currently, this SDK is in development by a small team at the Colorado School of Mines. As this project is open-source, any programmers are welcome to expand and enhance the functionality of the SDK or its modules. 

Past Collaborators:
- Andrew DeMaria
- Austin Diviness
- Aakash Shah
- Ryan Stauffer
- Matt Stech

# Contributing
Please, please help us with the project. The process to help with code is to
1. fork the repository and clone the forked repo
2. Make changes as you see fit (to the forked repo, do not change the clone of this repo) (extra points if you use [git feature branches][15])
3. Test your code and make sure that any previous tests pass
4. Push your commits to your forked repo
5. Using the github interface make a pull request to merge your forked repo and branch.
6. Done!
