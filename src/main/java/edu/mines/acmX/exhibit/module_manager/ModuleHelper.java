/**
 * This class is meant to be used as a delegated class instance inside other
 * classes implementing ModuleInterface such as ProcessingModule,
 * CommandlineModule, etc.  Note that this class is part of a multiple
 * inheritance design pattern for java.  If java ever gets its shit together
 * this will most likely all change, but as it is we are pretty confident in
 * javas inability to pull its head of a hole in the ground.  
 *
 * <h5>History</h5>
 * Again this class arose from a predicament by the team trying to have classes
 * such as ProcessingModule to have a parent of both a PApplet and a Module.
 * The solution to this was to wrap up the desired functionality into a
 * ModuleInterface.  Each abstract Module class such as Processing Module would
 * implement this interface (multiple implementing is allowed in java). Because
 * the implementation for the ModuleInterface would be the same between all the
 * implementing Modules we added a concrete ModuleHelper class to contain these
 * implementation details. This allows abstract Modules (i.e. ProcessingModule)
 * to implement ModuleInterface by delegating these methods to the ModuleHelper.
