/**
 * The Song class represents a collection of Tracks that are played

 * 
 * In order to create a song, you have two options:
 * 1.) You can define a List of Tracks and initialize the Song with the List
 * 2.) You can create a Song with the default constructor and add Tracks later
 * 
 * Once a Song is created, the 'startPlaying' method needs to be called to
 * start the Song, and the 'stopPlaying' method is called to stop it.
